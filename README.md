# HCI Assignment 2: Courses Prototype With Improvements

## About the Prototype

In this prototype, I've improved the UI/UX and HCI for this prototype by analysing other applications and my own applications against various metrics. I have made navigation more flexible, comfortable, and clear with many changes. The main changes include (but are not limited to) adding a courses menu to the navigation bar, allowing navigation to messages for a course from the home page, and indicating the current section of the app that a user is in by highlighting it in blue on the navigation bar. 

The prototype can be viewed in the following places:

## Needfinding / Competitive Analysis Section

For the needfinding section, I found a need for an application to help people with disabilities navigate the world with more ease and communicate their issues to each other and to business and institutions.

The top five new desireable functionalities for this application are as follows:

1) Live, community-driven reports of changes to accessibility features (ex. if an elevator is out of service)
2) Suggestions for alternative routes if one is blocked by an obstacle (ex. suggesting and locating a nearby elevator in the same building)
3) Providing information, links, and contact info surrounding a business/institution's accessibility features and sector
4) Ratings and reviews based on the accessibility of a location
5) Filtering of ratings and reviews by accessibility needs of a user
